                        Understanding this interplay is
                        important so that design choices and product development are based on concrete insights about

                            focus on the world of fashion which led me to my desk research where I delved into what my
                            target audience is and where
                            their interests lie within the world of fashion combined with what I felt there was a need

                        <p class="normal-p">Once I decied my site was going to be about fashion trendspotting, I made

                            I wanted my site to focus upon. The moodboard gives me insight to what I want to capture
                            upon my site and helps me
                            narrow down the design choices I will make towards my target audience. I made a styletile
                            after which is the guidline to
                            creating my website prototype and giving me a clear idea of its vision</p>

                        <p class="normal-p">Throughout the coding process I had to learn how to use divâ€™s in HTML to
                            organise my site into sections which I then can
                            use in my CSS to create its layout and style. This project also challenged me more to
                            broaden my knowledge within CSS</p>

                        <p class="normal-p">One of the challenges I faced was placing these circular links in a 2x2
                            grid. I had to go back and look at videos to
                            understand once again the difference between display: flex and display: grid in order to
                            achieve my desired layout. </p>

                    <p class="normal-p">The hardest part of this process was to find the correct ratio for the grids,
                        both large and small, so that no image or
                        text would overlap so I will take with me in my future projects that to have a set ratio/margin
                        on the borders of my
                        site and to practice more on grid structuring so that I am prepared to tackle them.</p>


                    <p class="normal-p-2">The general experience I also gained from this project was how to approach
                        creating a website from both a designers
                        angle and a developers angle as there were quite a few times throughout this project where I had
                        to to sacrafice
                        elements of my original prototype when coding as I was still in the early stages of learning how
                        to develop a site. It
                        taught me to apply more self discipline and rational thinking in the future when designing
                        future websites as I have to
                        remember skills I have and how far do I want to go in challenging myself to try new elements.
                    </p>
                    <p class="normal-p-2">Overall, creating this website taught me how to combine design and coding to
                        communicate fashion trends effectively. I
                        learned to structure content clearly, use visuals to tell a story, and ensure the site is
                        engaging and easy to navigate.
                        This project helped me improve my coding skills while balancing creativity with functionality
