                        Understanding this interplay is
                        important so that design choices and product development are based on concrete insights about

                        vague hunches and immediate assumptions</p>

                            focus on the world of fashion which led me to my desk research where I delved into what my
                            target audience is and where
                            their interests lie within the world of fashion combined with what I felt there was a need

                        <p class="normal-p">Once I decied my site was going to be about fashion trendspotting, I made
                            moodboards based upon the different countries
                            I wanted my site to focus upon. The moodboard gives me insight to what I want to capture
                            upon my site and helps me
                            narrow down the design choices I will make towards my target audience. I made a styletile
                            after which is the guidline to
                            creating my website prototype and giving me a clear idea of its vision</p>

                            guideline I can carry onwards into my coding, whereas the prototype gives me the structured

                        <p class="normal-p">Throughout the coding process I had to learn how to use div’s in HTML to
                            organise my site into sections which I then can
                            use in my CSS to create its layout and style. This project also challenged me more to
                            broaden my knowledge within CSS</p>

                        <p class="normal-p">One of the challenges I faced was placing these circular links in a 2x2
                            grid. I had to go back and look at videos to
                            understand once again the difference between display: flex and display: grid in order to
                            achieve my desired layout. </p>

                    <p class="normal-p">The hardest part of this process was to find the correct ratio for the grids,
                        both large and small, so that no image or
                        text would overlap so I will take with me in my future projects that to have a set ratio/margin
                        on the borders of my
                        site and to practice more on grid structuring so that I am prepared to tackle them.</p>


                    <p class="normal-p-2">The general experience I also gained from this project was how to approach
                        creating a website from both a designers
                        angle and a developers angle as there were quite a few times throughout this project where I had
                        to to sacrafice
                        elements of my original prototype when coding as I was still in the early stages of learning how
                        to develop a site. It
                        taught me to apply more self discipline and rational thinking in the future when designing
                        future websites as I have to
                        remember skills I have and how far do I want to go in challenging myself to try new elements.
                    </p>
                    <p class="normal-p-2">Overall, creating this website taught me how to combine design and coding to
                        communicate fashion trends effectively. I
                        learned to structure content clearly, use visuals to tell a story, and ensure the site is
                        engaging and easy to navigate.
                        This project helped me improve my coding skills while balancing creativity with functionality
